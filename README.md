# Apple Music Preview for Windows 10
The Windows 11 exclusive Apple Music Preview app running on Windows 10!

# What does this do?
This is a installer for the new Apple Music Client, it's supposed to be exlcusive to Windows 11. But, here's the funny thing. Almost ALL Windows 11 apps run on Windows 10 just fine. This is because the system is nearly the same. Just Windows 11 is buggier. Funny aint it? 

# How can I install this?
Well you can goto the releases page and there will be a .zip containing all of the files needed to install this.
1. Obviously download the .zip

2. While that downloads, goto Settings, Update and Security, For Developers. And enable "Install apps from any source, including loose files"

Just like in the image above

3. Now open and extract the zip file.

4. Run setup.bat, just double click it!

If you encounter any issues refer to the steps below. :)
# Is there any proof this works?
Yup here is a screenshot

# Installation
Download the latest .zip from releases, extract it. Then run setup.bat. Just double-click it. 

# Troubleshooting
Sometimes there may be UWP apps running or services that are running that the script cannot stop. A simple way to fix this is to go into Task Manager and Goto the "Startup" tab. And disable everything, then reboot

You can re-enable these after your done installing. 

# Known issues: 
None that I know of :D. At least none that aren't in the app itself. They can be replicated on Windows 11 as well.

# Notes:
 - This has not been tested on any Windows 10 version before 21H2. But it *should* work just fine. As the system files from 2004 and beyond are the same.
