# Apple Music Preview for Windows 10
The Windows 11 exclusive Apple Music Preview app running on Windows 10!

# What does this do?
This is a installer for the new Apple Music Client, it's supposed to be exlcusive to Windows 11. But, here's the funny thing. Almost ALL Windows 11 apps run on Windows 10 just fine. This is because the system is nearly the same. Just Windows 11 is buggier. Funny aint it? 

# How can I install this?
Well you can goto the releases page and there will be a .zip containing all of the files needed to install this. You will just run setup.bat!

# Is there any proof this works?
Yup here is a screenshot

# Known issues: 
None that I know of :D. At least none that aren't in the app itself. They can be replicated on Windows 11 as well.
